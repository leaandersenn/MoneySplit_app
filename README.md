### ðŸ“± Project Description

In this project, titled "MoneySplit," our team was tasked with developing an application that facilitates the tracking and division of shared expenses among users. Inspired by applications such as Splitwise and Tricount, MoneySplit aims to simplify the process of managing shared financial responsibilities within groups. The app's core functionality allows users to create shared groups for collective expenses, add individual expenses, and keep track of balances, detailing who owes whom and how much.
